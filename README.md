# nosycolors

My capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org).  I started just playing with data analysis and data visualization for my own entertainment.  It could conceivably show how a person's emotional state has trended recently, provided they use Twitter.

## A Rundown
* Pulls a given number of tweets for a given Twitter user.  
* Tokenizes tweets and runs language against a sentiment lexicon that I found [here](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html). 
* Creates donut charts with colored sections according to the emotional valence.  Accuracy is a work-in-progress, but it seems to hit the mark more often than not, which is fun.  
* Clicking on a chart brings up text from the tweet.
