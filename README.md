My capstone project for Ada Developers Academy.  I started just playing with data analysis and data visualization for my own entertainment.  Find it online [here](http://redsquirrelious.io).

## A Rundown
*Pulls a given number of tweets for a given Twitter user.  
*Tokenizes tweets and runs language against a sentiment lexicon that I found [here](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html). 
*Creates donut charts with colored sections according to the emotional valence.  Accuracy is a work-in-progress, but it seems to hit the mark more often than not, which is fun.  
*Clicking on a chart brings up text from the tweet.  

## The Stack (mostly new to me, JS/JQuery excepted)
*Python (including Tweepy and NLTK)
*Django
*JavaScript (including D3 and JQuery)
*MySQL
*AWS Elastic Beanstalk
