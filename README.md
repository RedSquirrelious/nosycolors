# nosycolors

Pulls a given number of tweets for a given Twitter user.  Tokenizes tweets and runs language against a sentiment lexicon that I found [here](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html). Creates donut charts with colored sections according to the emotional valence.  Accuracy is a work-in-progress, but it seems to hit the mark more often than not, which is fun.  Clicking on a chart brings up text from the tweet.
