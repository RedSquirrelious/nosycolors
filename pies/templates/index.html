            <p>Here it is: You know someone. Someone who's on Twitter. You're curious about this Someone. You want to know what they're saying, how they're feeling. Sure, you could read their tweets and guess.</p>
            <p>But maybe that's not enough.</p>
            <p>Maybe you don't want to do the work.</p>
            <p>Or maybe, just maybe, you trust computational linguistics and want science to bless your guess.</p>
            <p>This site is for you.</p>
